# Decision Insights & Execution Notes

This document demonstrates how product, revenue, and risk dashboards translate into **clear business decisions and operational actions**, rather than passive reporting.

## Insight 1 — Low activation is the root cause of downstream churn risk

### What we observed
- Activation penetration remained critically low at ~3%
- A large share of signups became “zombie accounts” (activated once, no sustained usage)
- Retention declined sharply after initial activation

### What this tells us
Acquisition success was **not translating into product value**.  
Low activation created a cascading effect: weak engagement → poor retention → rising revenue risk.

### Decision Taken
- Prioritize onboarding redesign over increasing acquisition spend
- Introduce clear activation milestones within the first 14 days
- Reframe onboarding success around value realization, not feature exposure

### Metrics Used
- Activation Rate  
- Activation Penetration  
- Avg Days to Activate (Time-to-Value)

## Insight 2 — Time-to-Value is a stronger predictor of retention than feature usage

### What we observed
- Businesses activating within ~20 days showed significantly higher retention
- Longer Time-to-Value correlated strongly with higher churn probability
- Feature usage frequency alone did not guarantee long-term retention

### What this tells us
Reaching value quickly matters more than using many features.  
Retention quality depends on *how users activate*, not *how often they log in*.

### Decision Taken
- Simplify early product paths to reduce cognitive load
- Add in-product guidance to accelerate first value realization
- Optimize activation flows around speed, not breadth

### Metrics Used
- Avg Days to Activate (TTV)  
- Activation → Retention Rate  
- Retained Activated Businesses

## Insight 3 — Revenue risk appears before churn events materialize

### What we observed
- At-Risk MRR increased while churned MRR remained temporarily stable
- Certain industries contributed disproportionately to revenue risk
- Churn spikes lagged behind early risk signals

### What this tells us
Churn is a **lagging indicator**.  
Revenue risk is a **leading indicator** that enables proactive intervention.

### Decision Taken
- Build a CS intervention playbook for high-risk segments
- Trigger proactive outreach before churn occurs
- Shift CS prioritization from churned accounts to at-risk revenue

### Metrics Used
- At-Risk MRR  
- Net MRR Churn %  
- Industry-level churn contribution

## Insight 4 — Feature adoption does not equal value realization

### What we observed
- High feature usage did not consistently translate into retention
- Retained users followed specific activation paths, not random feature exploration
- Some activated users disengaged despite continued feature access

### What this tells us
Value comes from sequenced usage, not isolated feature adoption.

### Decision Taken
- Redefine activation success criteria around value-driven journeys
- Focus product optimization on activation paths, not individual features
- Measure post-activation behavior, not just raw adoption

### Metrics Used
- Feature Adoption Post-Activation  
- Retained Activated Businesses  
- Activation Path Analysis
