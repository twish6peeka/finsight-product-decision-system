# Decision Notes & Insights

This document demonstrates how the dashboards translate into **real product, revenue, and operational decisions**.

---

## Insight 1: Activation drop created downstream churn risk

**Observation**

* Activation Penetration remained below 3%
* High number of zombie accounts (activated once, no follow-up usage)
* Retention rate declined sharply after activation

**Decision**

* Prioritize onboarding redesign over acquisition spend
* Introduce activation milestones within first 14 days

**Metric Triggered**

* Activation Rate
* Avg Days to Activate (TTV)

---

## Insight 2: Time-to-Value predicts retention quality

**Observation**

* Businesses activating within ~20 days showed higher retention
* Longer TTV correlated with higher churn probability

**Decision**

* Simplify early product paths
* Add in-product guidance to reach first value faster

**Metric Triggered**

* Avg Days to Activate
* Activation → Retention Rate

## Insight 3: Revenue risk surfaced before churn events

**Observation**

* At-Risk MRR grew while churned MRR stayed flat
* Certain industries contributed disproportionately to risk

**Decision**

* CS intervention playbook for high-risk industries
* Proactive outreach before churn materializes

**Metric Triggered**

* At-Risk MRR
* Net MRR Churn %

## Insight 4: Feature adoption ≠ retention

**Observation**

* Feature usage frequency alone did not guarantee retention
* Retained users followed specific activation paths

**Decision**

* Redefine activation success criteria
* Focus on *value-driven* feature sequences

**Metric Triggered**

* Feature Adoption Post-Activation
* Retained Activated Businesses
